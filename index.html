		  <p>
		I am a researcher whose subject of research is human. I help design interfaces, products, and packages by informing designers of human characteristics, usage, and acceptance. My research often requires knowing about humans and technology; so, I am trained in psychology and computer engineering.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I belong to a group of old-school psychologists who have a strong commitment to practical affairs. Works from people like Edward L. Thorndike and
		John C. Flanagan exemplify my interests.

		<p>
		2022 – Present: In <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:yellow" href="https://www.productventures.com/">Product Ventures Ltd.</a> I manage research projects on packaging and product design for well-known clients. I create experiments, moderate in-person focused groups, conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses, write reports, and collaborate with design and prototyping people.
		</p>	
		<p>
		2020: In a collaborative project between <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:yellow" href="https://aira.io/">Aira Tech Corp.</a> (San Diego, CA) and Penn State University, I helped in the process of designing interfaces for agents who remotely guide people with visual
		impairments.
		</p>
		<p>
		2018 – 2019: With <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:yellow" href="https://cra.com/">Charles River Analytics Inc.</a> (Cambridge, MA), I conducted a literature review and a meta-analysis to understand the
		effect of simulation fidelity on training transfer (see references 7 – 10 in the Publications at the bottom of this webpage).

		<span>
		<p>
		2021 – 2022: I was an instructor in Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST) for a course with the title of <i>Training and Technology</i>.
		Because the topic was central to my dissertation research, I was fortunate to have the chance to design the entire course and create its content independently. Videos of some lectures are available<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:yellow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EgjiAXdBJY&list=PLFHEwlJ3rUj61w_EL3UyiDQ9ybBr1piH-&index=7"> here</a>.
		 </p>
		
		<p>
		2016 – 2021: I was a teaching assistant in Penn State IST for <i>Foundations of Human-Centered Design</i> and <i>Statistics</i>. Prior to joining Penn State (from 2016 to 2018),
		I was a teaching assistant in Lehigh University’s Psychology Department for courses in <i>Psychology</i> and <i>Cognitive Science</i>. 
		</p>
			
		<p>
		2015 – 2016: I was a high school instructor, teaching <i>Introduction to Programming with C#</i> to senior high school students.

		<h5><b><p style="text-align:center" style="color:white">Hobbies</p></b></h5>
		<span>
		<p>
		I listen to classical music, drive and work on my car and motorcycle, go hiking, create video content and documentaries, write, travel, and sometimes read philosophy books in my free time.
		You can learn more about my taste in these hobbies in the <a href="Opinions.html" style="color:yellow">Opinions page</a>. I am currently making a video interview of some of the Iranian graduate students at Penn State that will soon be available.

	        <h5><b><p style="text-align:center;">Notes on Some Research Projects</p></b></h5>
	      <p>These are some of my research projects during the last few years. You can find the reference numbers in the Publications at the bottom of this page.</p>
	      <br>
	      	     <p style="text-align:center;"><i>Product Design and Packaging Research</i></p>

		 2022 – Present: In this set of research projects at Product Ventures Ltd., I investigate consumers' acceptance of design concepts and prototypes. Clients include companies that produce
		      various types of products. Some examples are drinking bottles, gym equipment, and food packages. We recruit a sample of consumers to investigate their choice,
		      how they use products, their preferences, and provide the selected design prototype to clients together with our research findings.

			</table>
	      
	      <p>
		 2020 – 2022: In this research I investigated the possible use of video on creating online job descriptions [11]. The question is whether embedding a short video of a job
		 and a day of life of an employee can influence job-seekers' attitude toward that job and organization, and whether it has any effect on job-seekers' decision to pursue employment in
		 that job and organization. The results from this research informs hiring managers of whether and how to use videos in online job descriptions.

		 2018 – 2022: Here, first I tried to understand the effect of the realism of training materials (or <i>simulation fidelity</i>) on the effectiveness of training (or <i>transfer</i>).
		 I conducted a series of studies, including a literature review and a meta-analysis, to determine the relationship between fidelity and transfer [7, 8, 10]. Then, I proposed a method that systematizes the use of experts' performance in designing training simulators.
		 The method uses the videorecording of experts at work (<i>ethnography</i>) to model their performance, and the model can directly guide the design of training simulators [9]. Although the
		 focus of these projects was the domain of troubleshooting electro-mechanical systems, other domains such as medical education, aviation, and transportation were also reviewed.
		 The modality of training devices ranged from simple drawings on a paper to virtual reality systems and sophisticated flight simulators. The results of this research
		 provided designers and developers with a set of easy-to-use guidelines in designing training simulators for troubleshooting tasks.

		<p>
			Sometimes, I enjoy addressing fundamental issues in my studies. For example, being convinced of the soundness of my research requires
			knowing about the history and foundational issues of psychology and its methods. In this respect, me and my colleague wrote a
			philosophically-oriented article that discusses the reason for our aversion to cognitivism and our defense of behaviorism [12].
		</p>
		<p>
			As part of my education in computer engineering (machine learning and AI), I conducted a project to understand
			human learning of functional relations (continuous-valued causal relations) [5]. The ultimate goal was to implement human learning in machines and understand how human learning works.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have also written articles on other topics of interest to academia in general, such as some aspects of technical and academic writing [6]. I am sharing some unpublished
			manuscripts that I wrote some years ago. They are not professional works in any sense; I was inexperienced when writing them. Nonetheless, they can
			show the evolution of my interests [1 – 4].
