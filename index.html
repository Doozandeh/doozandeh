		  Welcome to my website. I am a PhD candidate in the College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST) at Penn State, and it is my pleasure to work with John M. Carroll
		  as my advisor. My professional interest is in applied psychology, with a focus on topics in human factors and ergonomics, industrial and organizational psychology,
		  and human-computer interaction. My research often requires knowing about humans and technology; so, I am trained in psychology and computer engineering.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  Results of my research can be applied to design in various areas such as system, product, web interface, and instructions.
		  I belong to the group of old-school psychologists who have a strong commitment to practical affairs. So, figures such as Edward L. Thorndike and
		John C. Flanagan exemplify my type.
		</p>
		  
		  <p>

		<p>
		For the fall semester of 2021, I am an instructor in Penn State IST for a course that I have chosen its title to be <i>Training and Technology</i>.
		Because the topic has been central to my research, I am grateful that I had the chance to design the entire course.
		 </p>
		
		<p>
		From 2019 to 2021, I was a teaching assistant in the college of IST for courses in <i>Foundations of Human-Centered Design</i> and <i>Statistics</i>. From 2016 to 2018,
		I was a teaching assistant in Lehigh University’s Psychology Department for courses in <i>Psychology</i> and <i>Cognitive Science</i>. 
		I was also a high school instructor for one year (2015 – 2016), teaching <i>Introduction to Programming with C#</i>.

			  Most of my writings report the results of research. For example, I am currently conducting a research to investigate the possible use of videorecording on
			  job counseling and creating job descriptions [14, 15]. The results are of interest to researchers and practitioners in business, management, and industrial and
			  organizational psychology.
		</p>
		<p>
			A big part of my research concerns topics in human factors and ergonomics. For example, I proposed a method that directly uses experts' performance in designing training systems.
			The method used the videorecording of experts at work (<i>ethnography</i>) to model their performance, and the model can directly guide the design of training simulators [9].
			Proposing the videorecording method was rooted in a project that targeted the design of training-systems and simulators. Specifically, I conducted
			a series of reviews to investigate the effect of the realism of training materials (or <i>simulation fidelity</i>) on the effectiveness of training (or <i>transfer</i>) [7, 8, 12].
		</p>
		<p>
			Sometimes, I enjoy addressing some fundamental issues in my studies [11, 13]. For example, being convinced of the soundness of my research requires
			knowing about the history and foundational issues of psychology and its methods. In this respect, me and my colleague wrote a
			philosophically-oriented article that discusses the reason of our aversion to cognitivism and our defense of behaviorism [11].
		</p>
		<p>
			As part of my education in computer engineering, I conducted a research to understand
			human learning of functional relations (continuous-valued causal relations). The research was in the intersection of psychology and machine learning [5].
			This was an example of basic science, but over time my interest has shifted more toward applied topics.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, I have written articles on other topics of interest to academia in general [6]. Finally, I am sharing some unpublished
			manuscripts that I wrote some years ago. They are not professional works in any sense; I was inexperienced when writing them. Nonetheless, they can
			show the evolution of my interests [1, 2, 3, 4].
