		  Welcome to my website. I am a PhD student in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State, and it is my pleasure to work with Dr. John M. Carroll
		  as my advisor. My professional interest is in applied psychology, with a focus on topics in human factors, industrial and organizational psychology,
		  and human-computer interaction. The research that I do often requires knowing about humans and technology; so, I am trained in psychology and computer engineering.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  I belong to the group of old-school researchers who believe in the importance of task- and job-analysis in system design and various areas of applied psychology.
		  I have some experience of working with companies, and taught classes in various levels of education.
		  If you want to know more about my professional records and works,
		  please send me an email.</p>
		  
		  <p>To read my opinions about some areas of my interst, see the <a href="Opinions.html" style="color:white">Opinions page</a>. And I uploaded some videos

		  <p class="w3-text-grey">
		  Writing is one of my favorite hobbies and a part of my job. I have written on various topics, including my research and theoretical topics of my interest.
		  For example, as a part of my education in computer engineering, I conducted a research to understand human learning of functional
		  relations (continuous-valued causal relations). The research was in the intersection of psychology and machine learning. Here, you can find the report:
		  </p>

Quantification of human confidence in functional relations. <i>Cognitive Systems Research, 40</i>, 18–34. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:white" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S138904171530019X">(Access from publisher)</a>   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:white" href="files\docs\Doozandeh_2016_01.pdf">(Manuscript)</a></p></div>
		  <p class="w3-text-grey">
		  The above research can be categorized as basic science, but over time, my interest has shifted toward applied domains. For example, I have recently conducted a
		  series of studies to investigate the effect of the realism of training materials (or simulation fidelity) on the effectiveness of training (or transfer). These are the reports:

		  <p class="w3-text-grey">
		  Based on the results of this line of research, I became interested in studying expert individuals and modeling their performance. I think the model of expert performance can help designers
		  of training-systems by presenting a resource for design. Here, I am trying to draw renewed attention and refine the use of videorecording in
		  studying expert performance. So, I presented a design method for training-systems based on the videorecording of experts. The results are reported here:

Videorecording of experts as a method of training-simulator design. <i>Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science</i>, (in press) xx–xx. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:white" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/F5D5GCBMDCFKMRNEEDIU/full?target=10.1080/1463922X.2020.1864678">(Free access from publisher, limited copies)</a>   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:white" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1463922X.2020.1864678">(Access from publisher)</a>   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:white" href="files\docs\Doozandeh_2020_02.pdf">(Manuscript)</a></p></div>
		  <p class="w3-text-grey">
		  I think the videorecording method has undiscovered potentials in other domains of applied psychology as well, specifically job-analysis.
		  I am currently conducting a research to investigate the possible use of videorecording on job counseling and creating job descriptions. The question is: how watching
		  short videos of jobs can influence people's decisions in career choice? The future reports will be avilable here:

		  <p class="w3-text-grey">
		  Beside research-related writings, I have also written articles on miscellaneous topics. For example, here is a short note on academic writing:

         	<p class="w3-text-grey">
		 The topics of my current research come from my beliefs and opinions about science and its philosophical assumptions. I am a skeptic; so, being convinced of
		 the soundness of my activities would require knowing about the history and foundational issues of psychology and its methods. As such, I recently wrote a
		 philosophical article on cognitivism and behaviorism:
