2023 – present: As a Sr. UX/Human Factors Researcher in a contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs, I investigated the
implementation of a new nationwide electronic health record system (Oracle Millennium) in Veterans’ hospitals.
The goal was to understand the usability and user experience of the new system by deriving insights from users including
physicians, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists, and other healthcare professionals (through <i>Visionary Consulting Partners LLC.</i>).

		 that job and organization. The results from this research informed hiring managers of whether and how to use videos in online job descriptions.

		 investigated the effect of the realism of training materials (or <i>simulation fidelity</i>) on the effectiveness of training (or <i>transfer</i>).
		 I conducted a series of studies to determine the relationship between fidelity and transfer [7, 8, 10].
		 Then, I proposed a method that systematized the use of experts' performance in designing training simulators.
		 The method used the videorecording of experts at work to model their performance, and the model could directly guide the design of training simulators [9].
		 Although the focus of these projects was the domain of troubleshooting electro-mechanical systems, other domains such as medical education, aviation, and transportation were also reviewed.

		<p>
			Sometimes, I enjoy addressing fundamental issues in my studies. For example, being convinced of the soundness of my research requires
			knowing about the history and foundational issues of psychology and its methods. In this respect, me and my colleague wrote a
			philosophically-oriented article that discusses the reason for our aversion to cognitivism and our defense of behaviorism [12].
		</p>
		<p>
			As part of my education in computer engineering (machine learning and AI), I conducted a project to understand
			human learning of functional relations (continuous-valued causal relations) [5]. The ultimate goal was to implement human learning in machines and understand how human learning works.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have also written articles on topics of interest to academia in general, such as the problem of relying on metrics in academic evaluations [13] and 
			some aspects of technical and academic writing [6], as well as the design, maintenance, and policies of the built environment [14]. I am also sharing some unpublished manuscripts that I wrote some years ago [1 – 4]. They are not professional works in any sense; I was inexperienced when writing them. Nonetheless, they can
			show the evolution of my interests.
