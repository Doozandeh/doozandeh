		  <p>
		  Welcome to my website. I am a PhD student in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State, and it is my pleasure to work with John M. Carroll
		  as my advisor. My professional interest is in applied psychology, with a focus on topics in human factors, industrial and organizational psychology,
		  and human-computer interaction. My research often requires knowing about humans and technology; so, I am trained in psychology and computer engineering.
		  I belong to the group of old-school researchers who believe in the importance of task- and job-analysis in design and various areas of applied psychology.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>To read my opinions about some areas of my interest, see the <a href="Opinions.html" style="color:white">Opinions page</a>.

			  Most of my writings report the results of research. For example, I am currently conducting a research to investigate the possible use of videorecording on
			  job counseling and creating job descriptions. The question is how watching short videos of jobs can influence people's decisions in career choice. The results
			  can save time and costs for both job-seekers and organizations by increasing the accuracy of occupational placements [11, 12].
		</p>
		<p class="w3-text-grey">
			My interest in the videorecording method (or <i>ethnography</i>) came from a design method that I presented as part of my research on designing training-systems.
			That method used the videorecording of experts at work to model their performance, and the model can directly guide the design of training simulators [8].
		</p>
		<p class="w3-text-grey">
			My work in the research above and the focus on experts was rooted in a project that targeted the design of training-systems and simulators. Specifically, during my time
			in Frank E. Ritter's Applied Cognitive Science Lab, I conducted a series of reviews to investigate the effect of the realism of training materials
			(or <i>simulation fidelity</i>) on the effectiveness of training (or <i>transfer</i>). The results provided ready-to-use lessons to inform designers
			and organizations for the creation and adoption of training-systems [6, 7, 10].
		</p>
		<p class="w3-text-grey">
			Sometimes, I enjoy tackling some fundamental issues in my studies. In fact, the topics of my current research come from my beliefs
			and opinions about science and its philosophical assumptions. For example, being convinced of the soundness of my research requires
			knowing about the history and foundational issues of psychology and its methods. In this respect, me and my colleague wrote a
			philosophically-oriented article that discusses the reason of our aversion to cognitivism and our defense of behaviorism [9].
		</p>
		<p class="w3-text-grey">
			I also have the experience of conducting basic research. For example, as a part of my education in computer engineering, I conducted a research to understand
			human learning of functional relations (continuous-valued causal relations). The research was in the intersection of psychology and machine learning [4].
			This was an example of basic science, but over time my interest was shifted toward applied domains. This is one of the reasons behind my
			recent research interests.
		</p>
		<p class="w3-text-grey">
			Additionally, I have written articles on  other topics of interest to academia in general [5]. And finally, I am also sharing some unpublished
			manuscripts that I wrote some years ago. They are not professional works in any sense; I was inexperienced when writing them. Nonetheless, the
			reason that I am sharing them here is that I think it can show the evolution and the recurring themes of my interests [1, 2, 3].
