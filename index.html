		  <p>
		I am a PhD candidate in the College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST) at Penn State University. The topics of my professional interest
		are human factors and ergonomics and user experience research. My job often requires knowing about humans and technology; so, I am trained in psychology
		and computer engineering.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		 I belong to a group of old-school psychologists who have a strong commitment to practical affairs. So, figures such as Edward L. Thorndike and
		John C. Flanagan exemplify my type.
		</p>

		<p>
		2020: In a collaborative project between <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:white" href="https://aira.io/">Aira Tech Corp.</a> (San Diego, CA) and Penn State University, I helped improving the design of interfaces for agents who remotely guide people with visual

		</p>
		<p>
		2018 – 2019: With <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:white" href="https://cra.com/">Charles River Analytics Inc.</a> (Cambridge, MA), I conducted a literature review and a meta-analysis to understand the
		effect of simulation fidelity on training transfer (see List of Written Works 7, 8, and 12).

		<p>
		2021 – 2022: I am an instructor in Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST) for a course with the title of <i>Training and Technology</i>.
		Because the topic has been central to my research, I am fortunate to have the chance to design the entire course and create its content. Videos of some lectures are available<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:white" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbmjCgJZbs0&list=PLFHEwlJ3rUj61w_EL3UyiDQ9ybBr1piH-&index=2"> here</a>.

		I was a teaching assistant in Lehigh University’s Psychology Department for courses in <i>Psychology</i> and <i>Cognitive Science</i>. 
		</p>
			
		<p>
		2015 – 2016: I was a high school instructor, teaching <i>Introduction to Programming with C#</i> to senior high school students.

	        <h5><b><p style="text-align:center;">Highlights of Research Projects</p></b></h5>
	      <p>These are some of the research projects that I led during the last few years. You can find the reference numbers to publications at the bottom of this page.</p>
	      
	      <p style="text-align:center;"><i>Simulation Fidelity and Training</i></p>

				</td>

			</table>
	      
	      <p>
		 2018 – 2022: I tried to understand the effect of the realism of training materials (or <i>simulation fidelity</i>) on the effectiveness of training (or <i>transfer</i>).
		 I conducted a series of studies, including a literature review and a meta-analysis, to determine the relationship between fidelity and transfer [7, 8, 12]. Although the
		 focus of this project was on the domain of troubleshooting electro-mechanical systems, other domains such as medical education, aviation, and transportation were also reviewed.
		 The modality of training devices ranged from simple drawings on a paper to virtual reality systems and sophisticated flight simulators.

	      <br>
	       <p style="text-align:center;"><i>Designing Training Simulators</i></p>
	      
	      	      	<table width="50%" align="center" border="1" cellpadding="5">

				<p><i><font size="1">A Simulator Used to Train Truck Driving</font></i></p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
	      
	      <p>
		 2019 – 2021: I proposed a method that systematizes the use of experts' performance in designing training simulators.
		 The method uses the videorecording of experts at work (<i>ethnography</i>) to model their performance, and the model can directly guide the design of training simulators [9].
		 Similar to the research above, training in domains such as maintenance and troubleshooting, transportation, and using medical devices can benefit from this design method.

	      <br>
	      <p style="text-align:center;"><i>Designing Online Job Descriptions</i></p>

				<p><i><font size="1">A Video of A Job</font></i></p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
	      
	      <p>
		 2020 – 2022: In this research I investigated the possible use of video on creating online job descriptions [14]. The question is whether embedding a short video of a job
		 and a day of life of an employee can influence job-seekers' attitude toward that job and organization, and whether it has any effect on job-seekers' decision to pursue employment in
		 that job and organization.

			<button class="accordion">Some Other Projects</button>
			<div class="panel">

		<p>
			Sometimes, I enjoy addressing fundamental issues in my studies [11, 13]. For example, being convinced of the soundness of my research requires
			knowing about the history and foundational issues of psychology and its methods. In this respect, me and my colleague wrote a
			philosophically-oriented article that discusses the reason of our aversion to cognitivism and our defense of behaviorism [11].
		</p>
		<p>
			As part of my education in computer engineering (machine learning and AI), I conducted a project to understand
			human learning of functional relations (continuous-valued causal relations) [5]. The ultimate goal was to implement human learning in machines and understanding how human learning works.
			This was an example of basic science, but over time my interest has shifted toward applied topics.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have also written articles on other topics of interest to academia in general, such as some aspects of technical and academic writing [6]. Finally, I am sharing some unpublished
			manuscripts that I wrote some years ago. They are not professional works in any sense; I was inexperienced when writing them. Nonetheless, they can
			show the evolution of my interests [1 – 4].
