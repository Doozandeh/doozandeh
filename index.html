		  <p>
		  Welcome to my website. I am a PhD student in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State, and it is my pleasure to work with John M. Carroll
		  as my advisor. My professional interest is in applied psychology, with a focus on topics in human factors, industrial and organizational psychology,
		  and human-computer interaction. The research that I do often requires knowing about humans and technology; so, I am trained in psychology and computer engineering.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  I belong to the group of old-school researchers who believe in the importance of task- and job-analysis in system design and various areas of applied psychology.
		  I have some years of experience in working with companies, and I have taught classes in various levels of education.
		  If you want to know more about my professional records and works,
		  please send me an email.</p>

          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b><p style="text-align:center;">Some of My Written Works</p></b></h5>
		  <p class="w3-text-grey">
		  Writing is one of my favorite hobbies and a part of my job. I have written on various topics, from my research to theoretical and philosophical topics of my interest.
		  For example, as a part of my research during my Master’s education in Computer Engineering (AI), I conducted a research to understand human learning of functional
		  relation (continuous-valued causal relations). The research was in the intersection of psychology and machine learning, and I wrote this article to report the results:
		  </p>
		   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none" href="files\docs\Doozandeh_2016_01.pdf"><p>Doozandeh, P. (2016). Quantification of human confidence in functional relations. <i>Cognitive Systems Research, 40</i>, 18–34.</p></a>
		  <p class="w3-text-grey">
		  The above research can be categorized as basic science, but over time, my interest has shifted more toward applied domains. For example, I have recently conducted a
		  comprehensive literature review to investigate the effect of simulation fidelity (or the realism of training materials) on the effectiveness of training (or transfer). The report
		  is written here:
		  </p>
		  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none" href="files\docs\Doozandeh_2020_01.pdf"><p>Doozandeh, P. (2020). From surface realism to training considerations: A proposal for changing the focus in the design of training systems. <i>Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science</i>, (in press) xx–xx.</p></a>
		  <p class="w3-text-grey">
		  Based on the results of the review, I became interested in studying expert individuals and modeling their performance. The model of expert performance could help designers
		  by presenting a resource for design that could replace fidelity. Although such an attempt has been tried before, I am trying to draw renewed attention to using videorecording in
		  studying expert performance. So, I recently presented a design method for training-systems based on the videorecording of experts. The results are summarized here:

		  Doozandeh, P. (2020). Videorecording of experts as a method of training-simulator design. <i>Manuscript under review.</i>
		  </p>
		  <p class="w3-text-grey">
		  I think the videorecording has undiscovered potentials in other domains as well. A domain of my interest is Industrial and Organizational Psychology, specifically job-analysis.
		  I am currently conducting a research to investigate the possible effect of videorecording on creating job descriptions. Suppose you are looking to apply for jobs in internet.
		  Would it change your decisions and evaluations if you see a short video of the position that you are applying? I am currently working on this:

		  </p>
		  <p class="w3-text-grey">
		  Beside research-related writings, I have also written articles on miscellaneous topics. For example, I have written a short note on academic writing:
		  </p>
		  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none" href=""><p>Doozandeh, P., Ritter, F. E. (2019). Some tips for academic writing and using Microsoft Word. <i>XRDS: Crossroads, The ACM Magazine for Students, 26</i>(1), 10–11.</p></a>
         <p class="w3-text-grey">
		 The topics of my current research come from my beliefs and opinions regarding science and its philosophical assumptions. With respect to my topics, being convinced of
		 the soundness of my activities would require knowing about the history and foundational issues of psychology and its methods. In this regard, I recently wrote a
		 philosophical article on cognitivism and behaviorism:
