		  <p>
		  Welcome to my website. I am a PhD student in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State, and it is my pleasure to work with Dr. John M. Carroll
		  as my advisor. My professional interest is in applied psychology, with a focus on topics in human factors, industrial and organizational psychology,
		  and human-computer interaction. My research often requires knowing about humans and technology; so, I am trained in psychology and computer engineering.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  I belong to the group of old-school researchers who believe in the importance of task- and job-analysis in design and various areas of applied psychology.
		  If you want to know more about my professional experience and records, please send me an email.</p>
		  
		  <p>To read my opinions about some areas of my interest, see the <a href="Opinions.html" style="color:white">Opinions page</a>.

		  Most of my writings report the results of my research.
		  For example, as a part of my education in computer engineering, I conducted a research to understand human learning of functional
		  relations (continuous-valued causal relations). The research was in the intersection of psychology and machine learning. Here, you can find the report:

Quantification of human confidence in functional relations. <i>Cognitive Systems Research, 40</i>, 18–34. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:white" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S138904171530019X">(Access from publisher)</a>   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:white" href="files\docs\Doozandeh_2016_01.pdf">(Manuscript)</a></p></div>
		  <p class="w3-text-grey">
		  The above research can be categorized as basic science, but over time, my interest has shifted toward applied domains. For example, I have recently conducted a
		  series of studies to investigate the effect of the realism of training materials (or simulation fidelity) on the effectiveness of training (or transfer). These are the reports:

		  <p class="w3-text-grey">
		  Based on the results of this line of research, I became interested in studying expert individuals and modeling their performance. I think the model of expert performance can help designers
		  of training-systems by presenting a resource for design. Here, I am trying to draw renewed attention and refine the use of videorecording in
		  studying expert performance. So, I presented a design method for training-systems based on the videorecording of experts. The results are reported here:

Videorecording of experts as a method of training-simulator design. <i>Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science</i>, (in press) xx–xx. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:white" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/F5D5GCBMDCFKMRNEEDIU/full?target=10.1080/1463922X.2020.1864678">(Free access from publisher, limited copies)</a>   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:white" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1463922X.2020.1864678">(Access from publisher)</a>   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:white" href="files\docs\Doozandeh_2020_02.pdf">(Manuscript)</a></p></div>
		  <p class="w3-text-grey">
		  I think the videorecording method has undiscovered potentials in other domains of applied psychology as well, specifically job-analysis.
		  I am currently conducting a research to investigate the possible use of videorecording on job counseling and creating job descriptions. The question is: how watching
		  short videos of jobs can influence people's decisions in career choice? The future reports will be available here:

		  <p class="w3-text-grey">
		 Sometimes, I enjoy tackling some fundamental issues in my studies. In fact, the topics of my current research come from my beliefs
		 and opinions about science and its philosophical assumptions. For example, being convinced of the soundness of many of my research activities would require
		 knowing about the history and foundational issues of psychology and its methods. In this respect, I recently wrote a
		 philosophically-oriented article that discusses the reason of my aversion to cognitivism and my defense of behaviorism:

		<p class="w3-text-grey">
		  Beside research-related writings, I have also written articles on other topics of my interest. For example, here is a short note on academic writing:
