				This page contains my words on some of the topics of my interest and other issues that have caught my attention over time (no discussion of politics).
				If you think 'reason' or 'logic' can solve humanity's problems, do yourself and me a favor and close this tab. My words here are not arguments, nor are
				they reasoning. They simply reflect my beliefs, biases, and worldview; they are stances that would go beyond reasoning and analysis.<br>
				To categorize myself under the schools of thought, I can be associated with pragmatism, empiricism, skepticism, classicism, realism, and
				behaviorism (in psychology). It follows that I side against rationalism, cognitivism, modernism (in art and music), and things
				that become trends. I do not like to categorize myself with a bunch of “ism”s, but it was to give you a quick sense of my taste.
				The following paragraphs can do a better job at describing my opinions on some topics.

				Serious music can sometimes be found in what is known as classical. Outside classical, there is no serious music. Even within classical,
				most works are dull or painful to hear. For example, most works of modern classical music (post-1880s) are intolerable for
					sensitive ears. It is a self-inflicted pain if you <i>try</i> to understand most moderners.
				</p>
			<p>
				Romantic (19th century) and classic (18th century) periods are better than modern, but most composers of that time still made bad music.
				Mozart is overrated; most of his music is only good for children. Beethoven stands in the middle as he <i>can</i> make good music;
				he sometimes does and often does not. Schubert is better.
			</p>
			<p>
				Similar to painting, the music of the Baroque period (17th century) is the quintessence of music. Above all composers of that period, Bach stands as the master.
				Bach knows his job; composing music for humans! It is crucial to follow principles in any creation, especially in works of art, but Bach
				goes <i>beyond</i> principles. This is mastery. In short, Bach's creations are the greatest achievements of mankind in music so far. He has pieces that
				you can listen for your lifetime without getting repetitive.

			</p>
			<p>
			Good music should be performed by master performers. Who can perform masterfully? The one who knows how to play a piece as it is; serious, without deviations
			or dramatizations. An example of a master pianist is Sviatoslav Richter (1915–1997).

			If, and if, filmmaking is an art, one should not try to analyze it. But if we were to analyze filmmaking, I would just say that
			my favorite movies were made according to the old-school principles of filmmaking. Some of those principles can be formalized as they are the
			technique of filmmaking. But the rest of the principles can only be learned by experience and training on the craft. Filmmaking is in
			bringing innovation within the boundaries of the principles.
			</p>
			<p>
			Unfortunately, we see more and more cases in recent years that ignore the principles. Just take a cursory look at most of the films and series
			produced in recent years. They are suffering from ignoring the basic techniques of filmmaking.
			They follow empty trends. It is as though lacking principles has become a value for them.
			I am not hopeless as I still sometimes see decent movies and documentaries made recently.

			<button class="accordion" style="text-align:center">Academia</button>
			<div class="panel">
			<p>
			I think it helps if I repeat what is commonly expected from academia: education and training.
			Yes, this is something we should <i>remind</i> ourselves of. Good academic institutions focus on teaching their students and prepare the environment for
			this goal, and this is regardless of the distinction between “research” and “teaching” schools.
			</p>
			<p>
			Universities and colleges should be focused on teaching and advising students as their main priority. To achieve this goal, they
			need to have an <i>academic type</i> of people; those who are interested and are good at reading, learning, knowing, questioning, thinking, writing, speaking,
			and teaching. They should be excited about the topics of their interest, and enjoy spending time on those topics.
			</p>
			<p>
			The statements above are not idealistic; they are minimum requirements for people in academia regardless of their field of study. Yet, it is increasingly difficult to find
			such people in academia. Many academic institutions are not taking their original goal seriously.
			Below, I just scratch the surface of some of the problems of many academic institutions today.
			</p>
			<p>
			Most people who run today's academia are not of academic type. They do not have the tendency to think, do not have a writing style and clarity of presentation,
			and are not careful in their observations and inferences. They are people many of whom possess some or all of these characteristics:
			</p>
			<p>
				•	being committed to increase the <i>number</i> of their publications and similar statistics (like h-index in their Google Scholar) regardless of the quality of those works,<br>
•	judging other people and works with the number of publications, citations, or grants,<br>
•	having undue willingness to collaborate which can indicate their lack of independence,<br>
•	having undue interest in prizes, awards, certificates, and titles that are not necessarily awarded because of performance or professional achievements,<br>
•	creating unnecessary confusion in teaching or discussing subjects in their classes and meetings,<br>
•	lacking insight, even in their own field,<br>
•	lacking opinions or courage to express opinions,<br>
•	lacking honesty with their audience and with readers, and more importantly, with themselves,<br>
•	being indifferent to change anything in the world,<br>
•	lacking focus and being distracted with trivial topics and issues,<br>
•	following topics, affiliations, and tendencies that become social trends or are <i>hot</i> topics,<br>
•	designing their courses just to receive good student evaluations for the course, regardless of whether doing so can actually help students learning course materials,<br>
•	having interest in seeking <i>connections</i> that can be used to get grants, publish works, or get promoted,<br>
•	and adding names on research papers or grants as authors without sufficient contribution as a quid pro quo or as a favor,<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			And many more dishonorable characteristics. In short, academia has become bad <i>business</i> in many of our educational institutions.
			This is because, instead of the original goal, their attention has shifted toward how to improve a school’s rankings,
			increase the number of publications, and similar aims. 
			The bigger problem, however, is that these behaviors are practiced in such a scale that have made them into
			norms, and consequently, no longer look unprofessional. Newcomers (e.g., assistant professors) often adopt the mentality of "other people do it, and so do I";
			they establish a career on unethical premises. In an unhealthy competition for tenure or promotion, they become unprofessional professors.
			This situation is partly because many academic institutions put <i>new</i> items in their agenda (external grants, status in rankings, etc.).
			When the criteria of judging the performance of faculty are misplaced, the values would change and the result is what we see today on a mass scale.
			</p>
			<p>
			A big culprit of the current situation is the funding that comes from federal funding agencies such as NSF, NIH, the military, and
			some other federal institutions. Based on my observations, federal grants go to universities and fund projects that are
			good-for-nothing. The results of those projects do not change anything in the world; not now, nor any time in future. By labeling their activities
			as "basic science", unprofessional professors and researchers waste billions of dollars
			of taxpayers' money, and that money is a big part of what sustains universities these days. It is no surprise that major universities only
			recruit those for faculty positions who can bring federal grants.
			</p>
			<p>
			I should mention that during my time in academia, I have also seen serious academics who did not suffer from these problems. Good old-fashioned
			academics do not simply <i>need</i> to stain themselves with such practices, as their institutions judge their performance on healthy grounds.
			For my own academic responsibilities, my goal is to preserve what should be kept good in academia.
			</p>
			<p>
			Likewise, I believe there are academic institutions who still have their principles, respect themselves, and are not polluted by these problems.
			I think it is important to define, recognize, and distinguish the academic from un-academic characteristics with the hope to stop unhealthy trends,
			reinstate old values, and improve our academic institutions.

			This is a crisis. Why? Standard-quality products are disappearing. For many types of products (e.g., sneakers, kitchen appliances), either you should buy
			cheap products that are easily available in the market, or you should go to the warehouse of your parents and grandparents to see if you can find good-old
			products. Over time, online and offline retailers like Walmart and Amazon have become the selling agents of cheap manufacturers or well-known brands who
			manufacture overseas for cheap labor. Most good-old manufacturers who manufactured domestically (in the US and Europe) faced bankruptcy years ago.

				The external design of automobiles, which I care alot, has been particularly degraded. Look at some examples in the photos below.
				The design was functional, serious, and decent. All parts of the external design are in their proper place and in proper size.

				The emergence of the ugly universal automobile design and manufacturing happened during the 90’s—the same time that the automobile industry in the US and Europe
				started its decline (both in profit, and in design and quality). Look around and see the external design of newer models (especially post 2010's).
				Beside the problem of shape and external design, the quality of the materials that are used inside the cabin is lower than before. If you have a new car,
				just pay attention to the cheap plastic and other composite materials in the dashboard, steering wheel, doors, and handles. You should only be rich to buy
				a car with standard-quality cabin materials. This was not the case for older models (pre-90’s). The same goes to the mechanics of the cars. Nowadays, automobiles
				are full of unnecessary electronics that would not only make them more prone to total failures, but would make the owners go to dealers for any service.
				If I were a mechanic, I would have quit my job a long time ago. In short, almost everything in the auto industry was better prior to the 2010’s.
			</p>

			<p>
			I found that one of the main reasons behind this de-evolution is government regulation and incentives. For example, the government required manufacturers to
			make their automobiles “safer” both for passengers and for pedestrians. Also, the government decided to regulate fuel consumption. In doing so, automobiles
			had to follow some uniform guidelines to increase “safety” and fuel efficiency. That is why, for example, passengers’ window areas became smaller,
			back sections were raised, and the internal materials became lighter and cheaper.
			</p>
			<p>
			In fact, the government decided a big part of what automobiles look like today. I doubt if those regulators investigated, for example, the increased danger
			that lowering the driver’s visibility can create because of narrower windows. At the same time, manufacturers added unnecessary and
			bothersome “features” to automobiles such as big touch-screens in dashboards, driver assistance and guidance, and cameras that show the surroundings to the driver and passengers.
			If you are interested in these features, I have nothing to tell you. The least I can say is that they are unnecessary and bothersome, if not dangerous.
			When manufacturers do not (or cannot) have innovation in key areas of design and functionality, it is no surprise that they would try adding these unnecessary
			features.
			</p>
				
				<br>
				
			<p align="center"><i>So ...</i></p>
			
			<p>
			In short, if there is any remaining manufacturer of standard-quality products in the West, the price tag of their products will be astronomical. This is in part
			because those products are rare. The same products were much cheaper in the good-old days. It is interesting to see that the economic and business system that
			was supposed to favor consumers by reducing the prices have actually resulted in a sharp increase in prices of the same quality—indeed, only if you can still
			find those products in the market.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			This is a crisis. The crisis of not having decent manufactured products, and not producing them. The power of manufacturing industrial products is crucial
			for any healthy society, and this power is being taken away from the West by bad policies and governments.

			There are rules and principles in any art and craft. The rules and principles come from years of practice, as well as a healthy social and economic environment.
			Those principles guide human appreciation of beauty, harmony, and quality. Innovation and the art of creating "new" works should be in following the rules and principles,
