				This page contains my words on some of the topics of my interest and other issues that have caught my attention over time.
				They are not arguments, nor are they reasoning. They simply reflect my beliefs, biases, and ideology; they are stances that go
				beyond reasoning.<br>
				To categorize myself under the schools of thought, I can be associated with pragmatism, empiricism, skepticism, classicism, realism, and
				behaviorism (in psychology). It follows that I side against rationalism, cognitivism, modernism (in art and music), and things
				that become <i>trends</i>. I do not like to categorize myself with a bunch of “ism”s, but it was to give you a quick sense of my taste.
				The following paragraphs can do a better job at describing my opinions on some topics.

				Serious music can sometimes be found in what is known as classical. Outside classical, there is no serious music. Even within classical,
				most works are dull or painful to hear. For example, most modern classical music (post-1880s) sounds intolerable for
					sensitive ears. It is a self-inflicted pain if you <i>try</i> to understand most moderners.
				</p>
			<p>
				Romantic (19th century) and classic (18th century) periods are better than modern, but most composers of that time still made bad music.
				Mozart is overrated; most of his music is only good for children. Beethoven stands in the middle as he <i>can</i> make good music;
				he sometimes does and often does not. Schubert is better.
			</p>
			<p>
				The music of the Baroque period (17th century) is the quintessence of music. Above all composers of that period, Bach stands as the master.
				Bach knows his job; composing music for humans! It is crucial to follow principles in any creation, especially in works of art. But Bach
				goes <i>beyond principles</i>. This is mastery. In short, Bach's creations are the greatest achievements of mankind in music so far. He has pieces that
				you can listen to for your lifetime without becoming repetitive. But it has to be performed masterfully.

			</p>
			<p>
			Who can perform masterfully? The one who knows how to play a piece as it is; serious, without deviations or dramatizations. One who knows the importance
			of silence and stress. An example of a master pianist is Sviatoslav Richter (1915–1997).

			It is interesting that the exact same period of time (from 1600 to 1900) applies to my interest in painting. The more recent the worse it gets on average.
			In general, classics often represent the highest achievements of mankind in arts hitherto.

			If, and if, filmmaking is an art, one should not try to analyze it. But if we were to analyze filmmaking, I would just say that
			my favorite movies were made according to the old-school principles of filmmaking. Some of those principles can be formalized as they are the
			technique of filmmaking. But the rest of the principles can only be learned by experience and training on the craft. Filmmaking is in
			bringing innovation within the boundaries of the principles.
			</p>
			<p>
			Unfortunately, we see more and more cases in recent years that ignore the principles. Just take a cursory look at most of the films and series
			produced in recent years. They are suffering from ignoring the basic techniques of filmmaking; they do not reach the level of art.
			They follow empty trends. It is as though lacking principles has become a value for them.
			I am not hopeless as I still sometimes see decent movies and documentaries made recently.

			To understand philosophy, one’s life should be accompanied with doubt and reflection. Attempts to <i>learn</i> do not help much; it should come naturally.

			<button class="accordion" style="text-align:center">Academia</button>
			<div class="panel">
			<p>
			I think it helps if I repeat what is commonly expected from academia: it is education and training.
			Yes, this is something we should <i>remind</i> ourselves of. Good academic institutions focus on teaching their student body and prepare the environment for
			this goal, and this is regardless of the distinction between “research” and “teaching” schools.
			</p>
			<p>
			Universities and colleges should be focused on teaching and advising students as their main priority. To achieve this goal, they
			need to have an <i>academic type</i> of people; those who are interested and are good at reading, learning, knowing, questioning, thinking, writing, speaking,
			and teaching. They should be excited about the topics of their interest, and enjoy spending time on those topics.
			</p>
			<p>
			The statements above are not idealistic; they are minimum requirements for people in academia regardless of their field of study. Yet, it is increasingly difficult to find
			such people in academia. Many academic institutions are not taking their original goal seriously, and they are immersed in distractions.
			Below, I just scratch the surface of some of the problems of many academic institutions today.
			</p>
			<p>
			Most people who run today's academia are not of academic type. They do not have the tendency to think, do not have a writing style and clarity of presentation,
			and are not careful in their observations and inferences. They are people many of whom possess some or all of these characteristics:
			</p>
			<p>
				•	being committed to increase the <i>number</i> of their publications and similar statistics (like h-index in their Google Scholar) regardless of the quality of those works,<br>
•	judging other people and works with the number of publications, citations, or grants,<br>
•	having undue willingness to collaborate which can indicate their lack of independence,<br>
•	having undue interest in prizes, awards, certificates, and titles that are not necessarily awarded because of performance or professional achievements,<br>
•	creating unnecessary confusion in teaching or discussing subjects in their classes and meetings,<br>
•	lacking insight, even in their own field,<br>
•	lacking opinions or courage to express opinions,<br>
•	lacking honesty with their audience and with readers, and more importantly, with themselves,<br>
•	being indifferent to change anything in the world,<br>
•	lacking focus and being distracted with trivial topics and issues,<br>
•	following topics, affiliations, and tendencies that become social trends or are <i>hot</i> topics,<br>
•	designing their courses just to receive good student evaluations for the course, regardless of whether doing so can actually help students learning course materials,<br>
•	having interest in seeking <i>connections</i> that can be used to get grants, publish works, or get promoted,<br>
•	and adding names on research papers or grants as authors without sufficient contribution as a quid pro quo or as a favor,<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			And many more dishonorable characteristics. In short, academia has become bad <i>business</i> in many of our educational institutions.
			This is because, instead of the original goal, their attention has shifted toward how to improve a school’s rankings,
			increase the number of publications, and similar aims. 
			The bigger problem, however, is that these behaviors are practiced in such a scale that have made them into
			norms, and consequently, no longer look unprofessional. Newcomers (e.g., assistant professors) often adopt the mentality of "other people do it, and so do I";
			they establish a career on unethical premises. In an unhealthy competition for tenure or promotion, they become unprofessional professors.
			This situation is partly because many academic institutions put <i>new</i> items in their agenda (external grants, status in rankings, etc.).
			When the criteria of judging the performance of faculty are misplaced, the values would change and the result is what we see today on a mass scale.
			</p>
			<p>
			A big culprit of the current situation is the funding that comes from federal funding agencies such as NSF, NIH, the military, and
			some other federal institutions. Based on my observations, federal grants go to universities and fund projects that are
			good-for-nothing. The results of those projects do not change anything in the world; not now, nor any time in future. By labeling their activities
			as "basic science", unprofessional professors and researchers waste billions of dollars
			of taxpayers' money, and that money is a big part of what sustains universities these days. It is no surprise that major universities only
			recruit those for faculty positions who can bring federal grants.
			</p>
			<p>
			I should mention that during my time in academia, I have also seen serious academics who did not suffer from these problems. Good old-fashioned
			academics do not simply <i>need</i> to stain themselves with such practices, as their institutions judge their performance on healthy grounds.
			For my own academic responsibilities, my goal is to preserve what should be kept good in academia.
			</p>
			<p>
			Likewise, I believe there are academic institutions who still have their principles, respect themselves, and are not polluted by these problems.
			I think it is important to define, recognize, and distinguish the academic from un-academic characteristics with the hope to stop unhealthy trends,
			reinstate old values, and improve our academic institutions.

			From design to selecting the raw materials and finishing, certain principles should guide the production process.
			Generally speaking, products have become cheaper over time, both in quality and design. Just look at the pictures below. These products followed the principles of

			This is a crisis. Why? Standard-quality products are disappearing. For many types of products (e.g., sneakers, kitchen appliances), either you should buy
			cheap products that are easily available in the market, or you should go to the warehouse of your parents and grandparents to see if you can find good-old
			products. Over time, online and offline retailers like Walmart and Amazon have become the selling agents of cheap manufacturers. Almost all good-old

				Automobile industry is a good example of how western manufacturing and design has lost quality in certain aspects over time. For example, the external design of automobiles has been
				particularly degraded. The emergence of the universal cheap automobile design and manufacturing happened during the 90’s—the same time that the automobile industry
				in the US started its decline (both in profit, and in design and quality). Look at some examples from the 80’s in the photos below. The design was functional, serious,
				and decent. All parts of the external design are in their proper place and in proper size.

			But look around and see the external design of newer models (especially post 2000's). In plain terms, many of them are deformed.
				Beside the problem of shape and external design, the quality of the materials that are used inside the cabin is lower than before. If you have a new car, just pay attention
				to the cheap plastic and other composite materials in the dashboard, steering wheel, doors, and handles. You should only be rich to buy a car with
				standard-quality cabin materials. This was not the case for older models (pre-90’s). In short, many things in the auto industry were better prior to the 90’s.
			</p>

			<p>
			I found that one of the main reasons behind this de-evolution is government regulation. The government indirectly ordered manufacturers to make their automobiles “safer”
			both for passengers and for pedestrians. And, the government decided to regulate fuel consumption. In doing so, automobiles had to follow some uniform guidelines
			to increase “safety” and fuel efficiency. That is why, for example, passengers’ window areas became smaller, back sections of chassis were raised, and the internal
			materials became lighter and cheaper.
			</p>
			<p>
			In fact, the government decided a big part of what automobiles look like. I doubt if those regulators investigated, for example, the increased danger that lowering
			the driver’s visibility can cause. In this situation, what many manufacturers did, instead, was to add unnecessary and
			bothersome “features” to automobiles such as big touch-screens in dashboards, driver assistance and guidance, and cameras that show the automobile’s surroundings.
			When manufacturers do not (or cannot) have innovation in key areas of design and functionality, it is no surprise that they would try adding unnecessary features.
			</p>
			<p>
			For a more detailed discussion on the topic, I found <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/design-regulations-helped-ruin-american-cars/" target="_blank" style="color:yellow">this webpage</a>
			to be good.</p>
			<p>
			The cheapening of quality is impending for the world of motorcycles as well. For example, newer models should follow strict governments' emissions
			regulations. Also, manufacturers like Honda, Kawasaki, Harley-Davidson, and some others are producing many of their models in countries with cheap labor (e.g., India and Thailand)
			and this will reduce their quality and reliability. If the current trend in industry and economy continues, the same problems that took over
			the auto industry will also wipe out good old-fashioned motorcycle manufacturing.
			</p>
				
				<br>
				
			<p align="center"><i>So ...</i></p>
			
			<p>
			In short, if there is any remaining manufacturer of standard-quality products in the West, the price tag of their products will be astronomical. This is in part
			because those products are rare. The same products were much cheaper in the good-old days. It is interesting to see that the economic and business system that
			was supposed to favor consumers by reducing the prices have actually resulted in a sharp increase in prices of the same quality—indeed, only if you can still
			find those products in the market.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			This is a crisis. The crisis of not having decent manufactured products, and not producing them. The power of manufacturing industrial products is crucial
			for any healthy society, and this power is being taken away from the West (and by the West). This might even be dangerous. The reasons for this situation
			are naïve economic and business policies, bad management, and short-sighted interest in making profit.

			<p>
			There are rules and principles in any art and craft. The rules and principles come from years of practice, as well as a healthy social and economic environment.
			Those principles guide human appreciation of beauty, harmony, and quality. Innovation and the art of creating "new" works should be in following the rules and principles,

			In what I discussed above under different topics, the concept of <i>decency</i> would embody my interests; decent works of art, decent academics,
